# Assignment 03 - Lightning Payment

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate that you can start a lightning node, open a channel with another peer, send a payment, and close the channel.

## Requirements

* A document or script within your repository, which shows your work in setting up a lightning node, opening a channel, sending a payment, and closing the channel.

* The transaction ID of the lightning "channel" transaction, on the Bitcoin Testnet network. It should be publicly viewable on a Blockchain explorer, such as [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/testnet).

## Examples

You will find some examples of how to start a lightning node in the `lnd-demo` folder. Feel free to use any software implementation of Lightning, such as LND, Core Lightning, Eclair, etc.
