# Assignment 01 - Bitcoin Transaction

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate that you can construct a valid bitcoin transaction, and broadcast it successfully on the Bitcoin Test Network.

## Requirements

* A summary of your work in constructing and broadcasting the transaction. If you used a script or program to send the transaction, please include that as well.

* The transaction ID of the Bitcoin transaction, on the Bitcoin Testnet network. It should be publicly viewable on a Blockchain explorer, such as [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/testnet).

## Examples

You will find some examples of how to construct a transaction in the `examples` folder, and references to past lectures in the `slides` folder in this repository.
